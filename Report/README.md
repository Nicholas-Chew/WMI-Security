# Windows Management Instrumentation Security

## Background
### Introduction topic area
1. Cyberattack
2. Hacker becoming more sophisticated that system admin
3. One of the recent big attack - Wanna Cry
### Narrows down to specific issues
1. Cyber attack with the use of file, malware, is easy to find with a Security Analyst
2. Modern technique don't use malware and levarages mostly on tools that are legitiatmate system management tool like Windows Management Instrumentation.
3. These attacks normally goes under the radar of Security Protection softwares and it is very hard to find as it is normally sotred in very unusual place like the Registery.
4. Attacker are using these techniques to comporimise enviroments, maintain persistance and further their goals.
5. These Legitiatmate system management tool brings convenienct to system admin, however the flip side is, it also increases the risk of the computer.

## Research Gap
 ### Defines the problem and the need to futher research
1. One of these legitiatmate system management tool is Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) 
2. WMI history
3. What can WMI do?
4. Why is WMI dangerous?
5. WMI attack History. WannaCry
